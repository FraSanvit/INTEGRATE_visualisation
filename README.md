# INTEGRATE_visualisation
This repository contains the code necessary to visualize Eurocalliope results used for the Integrate project. The underlying model is based on pre-built scenarios generated from Sector-Coupled Europe. The outputs are processed according to the Calliope-friendly data format, and the code is structured accordingly.
